# Security Bot

Bot that scans various security announcement feeds and sends slack notifications
for items that match rules. Rules are configured as regular expressions.

## Overview

There are many security lists, CVE's and other announcements in the wild which 
make it hard to see signal in the sea of noise. If you're a developer, there's a
chance that you alreay follow a few sources via email or rss. This bot is here to
automate a basic task of fetching and matching terms that you're interested in and
delivering them to a slack channel so everyone on your team can keep up to date.

# Format specifies the general structure of regular expression.

## Deployment

This project was created in a day so there was not any plans on rolling it out to
any hosting provider like Heroku. We're running it via cron job on a chep DigitalOcean
droplet. It worksâ„¢.

Here's an example: (`crontab -e`)

```
*/5 * * * * bash -c "cd /home/deploy/security-bot && /usr/local/bin/bundle exec rake run >> /home/deploy/security-bot.log"
```
